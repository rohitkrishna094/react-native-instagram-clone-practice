##### This is a practice code from [Simcoder's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hPgQWbWmEk) tutorial.

* This is incomplete as of today. Start from 3:55:42 in the above video.

##### Todo in Future

* Use hooks instead of class components
* Use async awaits for firebase.then... calls
* Avoid too many firebase calls and look for a better solution to fetch user data, posts etc
* Refactor a lot of duplicate code from the tutorial.

Note:
* Rename firebaseConfig.sample.js to firebaseConfig.js and add firebaseConfig from firebase console.
